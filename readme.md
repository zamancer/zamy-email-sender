# Zamy Email Sender

This is a project I am using in order to develop and automate some emails for different hobbies and side hustle projects. It is based on top of react email starter template.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```sh
npm install
# or
yarn
```

Then, run the development server:

```sh
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
